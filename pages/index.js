            Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of optimizing a
            website for Google search with the goal of earning higher web
            traffic levels and improving the visibility of the site. SEO
            involves on-page optimization, off-page optimization, and link
            building.
          </p>
          <p>
            On-page optimization includes optimizing website title tags, meta
            tags, and content for relevant keywords.
          </p>
          <p>
            Off-page optimization includes optimizing website descriptions and
            anchor text, as well as building backlinks to the site. Link
            building is the process of acquiring links from other websites to
            your own website. This helps to improve the SEO of your site by
            increasing its link popularity.
